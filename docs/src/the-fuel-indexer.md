![Fuel Logo](./img/fuel.png)

The Fuel indexer is a standalone service that can be used to index various components of the blockchain. These indexable components include blocks, transactions, receipts, and state within a Fuel network, allowing for high-performance read-only access to the blockchain for advanced dApp use-cases.

Events are indexed by the Fuel indexer by using WASM modules, as described in [Wasm Module section](./components/assets/wasm.md).
