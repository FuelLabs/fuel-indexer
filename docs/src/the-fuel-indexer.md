# Fuel Indexer

![Fuel Logo](./img/fuel.png)

The Fuel Indexer is a standalone binary that can be used to index various components of the blockchain. These indexable components include blocks, transactions, receipts, and state within a Fuel network, allowing for high-performance read-only access to the blockchain for advanced dApp use-cases.

Events can be indexed by the Fuel Indexer by using WASM modules, as described in [the Hello World example](./src/examples/hello-indexer.md).
