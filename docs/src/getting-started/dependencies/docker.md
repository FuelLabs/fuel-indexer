# Docker

If you don't want to install the Fuel indexer or its dependencies directly onto your system, you can use Docker to run it as an isolated container. You can install it by following the [install instructions](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). For reference purposes, we provide a [`docker compose` file](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-indexer/blob/master/scripts/docker-compose.yaml) that runs a Postgres database and the Fuel indexer service.
