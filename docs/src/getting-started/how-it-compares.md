# How it Compares

- Since many users may be familiar with indexing by using a solution like The Graph, it may be helpful to provide a comparison between The Graph and the Fuel indexer.
- Generally, the biggest conceptual differences between other indexer services such as The Graph, and Fuel's indexer service include: indexing speed, general ease of use, and the type of data that can be indexed.

## Differential Value

### Speed of indexing
- Using Fuel's indexers, users can index about 30 blocks per second on a standard Macbook Pro on an M1 chip. This type of indexing speed is a boon to smart contract authors who need to iterate quickly while building dApps.

### General usability
- Unlike other indexing services, with the `forc index` CLI tool, users can create, deploy, update, re-deploy, remove, and check the status of their indexers. The ability to completely manage, maintain, and improve remote indexers without having to open any files, or edit any source code completely sets Fuel's indexer apart from other services in the space.

### What you can index
- The Fuel indexer is tailored for compatibility with the FuelVM. Meaning, whereas with services like The Graph, indexer operators are limited to some of the primitives of the EVM - with the Fuel indexer, users get a much richer set of indexable abstractions provided by the FuelVM (e.g., predicates, transaction receipts, etc).
