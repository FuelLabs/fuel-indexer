# GraphQL

The Fuel indexer uses GraphQL to in order to allow users to query for indexed data. Please note that the Fuel indexer does not support the full GraphQL specification; however, we do our best to reasonably support as much as we can. In this chapter, you can find information on how to leverage our supported features to efficiently get the data you want.
