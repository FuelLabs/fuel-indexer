# Indexing


> If you've previously built an indexer for the EVM, you may be used to only being able to index data that is emitted as an event.

> However, with Fuel you can index the entire transaction, which means you can use much more than logged data, allowing you to reduce the number of logs you need in your contract.

You can index two types of data: Fuel types, and Custom types:


### Fuel types

> Description

- [Blocks](./fuel-types/blocks.md)
- [Transactions](./fuel-types/transactions.md)
- [Transaction Receipts](./fuel-types/receipts/index.md)

### Custom types

> Description
