# `TransactionData`

> The `TransactionData` struct contains important information about a transaction in the Fuel network. The `id` field is the transaction hash, which is a 32-byte string. The `receipts` field contains a list of `Receipts`, which are generated by a Fuel node during the execution of a Sway smart contract; you can find more information in the [Receipts](./receipts.md) section.

## Definition

```rust,ignore
pub struct TransactionData {
    pub transaction: Transaction,
    pub status: TransactionStatus,
    pub receipts: Vec<Receipt>,
    pub id: TxId,
}
```

## Usage

```rust,ignore
extern crate alloc;
use fuel_indexer_utils::prelude::*;

#[indexer(manifest = "my_indexer.manifest.yaml")]
mod my_indexer {
    fn handle_transaction(block_data: BlockData) {
        let height = block_data.header.height;
        if !block_data.transactions.is_empty() {
            let transaction = block_data.transactions[0];
            info!("Transaction {} in block at height {} has {} receipts", transaction.id, block_data.header.height, transaction.receipts.len());
        }

    }
}
```
