# Indices

Indices are the one of the core building blocks of the Fuel indexer service. Indices allow index operators and dApp authors to index specific blockchain into a database.

A given index is constructed of a few assets: a manifest file, a GraphQL schema file, and a WASM module. Read more about this in the [Assets](./../assets/index.md) section.
