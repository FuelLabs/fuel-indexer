# Assets

A Fuel index is constructed of a few assets: a manifest file, a GraphQL schema file, and a WASM module.

- [Manifest](./manifest.md)
  - Supplies metadata regarding how a given index should run.
- [Schema](./schema.md)
  - Details how data should be stored in the database.
- [WASM modules](./wasm.md)
  - A compiled binary that is registered into a Fuel indexer at runtime.
